# gpt-gerald
Created a talking GPT bot named Gerald.

Set-Up Process:
  - Change your API KEY in the config file

Process:
  1. Speech to text
  2. Text to GPT
  3. GPT response to my program
  4. Response to Audio
  5. BAM... DONE!
  6. Repeat

What I would like to add:
  - Smoother interface that recognizes when I am done talking and maybe a button that tells it when to start listening in case the user needs time to think of a question (ideally Gerald should just be able to recognize the silence and know not to start talking).
